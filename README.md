Once you have filled out both fields, hit the submit button to get your results. The information that you give us here is used to determine what reviews that you will see, what clothes that you are presented with, as well as the ratings and a short summary of the company.

## The interview information page
The centerstone of our app! The interview page is here to display all of the information you will need to know to prepare you for an interview! The interview page is split up into two tabs, Information and Attire.

### Information
The information page is a tab of the interview page. This tab is here so that you can benefit from our knowledge. We will pull reviews for you from glassdoor(a company ratings site) as well as allow you to generate your own reviews if you have worked for the company that you are searching for. The information tab is split up into two columns. The first column starts off with the name of the company and the ratings for that company.
***
* Ratings
  * Ratings are split up into 3 categories.
  * Total Rating, the average of all of the ratings combined for the company that you have searched.
  * Benefits Rating, the average rating for the benefit approval ratings for the company.
  * Balance Rating, the work life balance that the company so that you can gauge how much of yourself you want to invest in the company.

***
At the bottom of the left column you can see reviews specifically for people that have interviewed with the company. In addition, if you have interviewed already with the company you can add your own review! Important information that we need is you experience at the interview, the length of the interview, and the difficulty of the interview.

The right column is about general company reviews. At the top of the column you will see a review that is pulled from glassdoor. The review has a headline, some pros about working for the company, and some cons about working for the company. We thought that it was important to add reviews into your experience so that you could gague how well the company is doing in term of customer satisfaction or the satisfaction of its employees. Below the review will be an area where employees can add their own reviews about the company.
  * Reviews for a company are very straight forward. We are trying to grow our database, but we can't do that without you! If you have worked for the company searched, please submit a review to our site so that others can see what you think.
  * What we need from you: Please tell us about some pros of working for the company, some downsides about working for the company, the area you worked in, the dress code that you adhered to, as well as the size of your company.

### Attire
The next tab is the Attire tab. The Attire tab is all about what you should wear to your interview. Once you click on the attire tab you will see some main boxes in front of you. Those boxes are our ideas about what a person should generally wear to any type of interview. We have suggested a category of clothing for you to look at, but in the end it is up to you to decide what you will wear to your interview.
  * There are four categories of dress
  * Formal/Conservative
  * Fashionable
  * Business Casual
  * Casual
Each of these categories will have their own seperate box of clothes to choose from. If you click on a box of your choice, it will open up into a larger area where you can browse the clothes in more detail. Clothing items come with pictures of the clothes, as well as a short description of the clothes. Clothes and interview outfits are all pulled from Pintrest API.
